#Python, by contrast, recommends snake case, whereby words are instead separated by underscores (_), with all letters in lowercase. For instance, those same variables would be called name, first_name, and preferred_first_name, respectively, in Python.In a file called camel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a variable in camel case and outputs the corresponding name in snake case. Assume that the userâ€™s input will indeed be in camel case.def camel_to_snake(camel_case):
def main():
    camel = input("camelCase: ")
    snak = ""
    for i in camel:
        if i.isupper():
            snak += "_" + i.lower()
        else:
            snak += i
    print("snake_case:", snak)

main()
