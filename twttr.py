#When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally called twttr. In a file called twttr.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a str of text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.
def main():
    vowels=["a","e","i","o","u","A","E","I","O","U"]
    strin=""
    string=input("Input: ")
    for i in string:
        if i in vowels:
            continue
        else:
            strin+=i
    print(f"Output:{strin}")
main()
